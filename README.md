1. Introduction
This project contains various C programs that demonstrate fundamental programming concepts such as:

Variables and Data Types
Control Structures (if, for, while)
Functions
Arrays and Strings
Pointers
Structures
File I/O
Dynamic Memory Allocation
The primary goal is to provide a hands-on approach to learning C programming through practical examples and exercises.

2. Features
Comprehensive examples covering all fundamental aspects of C programming.
Well-documented code for easy understanding.
Sample programs for beginners and advanced users.
Exercises to practice and enhance your programming skills.

3. Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed:

A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, or MSVC)
A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion, Eclipse)
To check if GCC is installed, run the following command in your terminal:

bash: gcc --version
If you see a version number, GCC is installed.

4. Installation
Clone the Repository

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash : git clone https://github.com/your-username/c-programming-project.git
cd c-programming-project
Compile the Code

Navigate to the directory containing the .c files you wish to compile and run the following command:

bash : gcc filename.c -o outputfile
Replace filename.c with the name of your source file and outputfile with the desired name for the compiled program.

Run the Program

After compiling, run the executable using:

bash : ./outputfile
Replace outputfile with the name you provided during compilation.

5. Usage
This repository contains multiple C programs organized into different directories based on the topic. To run a program:

Navigate to the corresponding directory.
Compile the .c file using GCC or any other C compiler.
Run the compiled executable.
For example, to run a program on Arrays:

bash : cd Arrays
gcc array_example.c -o array_example
./array_example
